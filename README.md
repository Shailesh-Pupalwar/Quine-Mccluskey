# Quine-McCluskey

This is the Python 3 implementation of Quine McCluskey algorithm to minimize logical expressions.

This Python script takes minterms and don't care terms(if any) as input and then produces the reduced expression as output.

It displays the whole process of calculating the result.

It displays the minterm groups, Prime Implicant chart and Essential prime implicants while calculating the output.

It uses Petrick's Method to calculate minimized expression from prime implicants chart.

I created this script just for fun. So, there might be some errors. Feel free to report them to me.
